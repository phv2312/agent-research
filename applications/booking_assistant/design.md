# Architecture

There are two workflows: **Chat** and **Indexing**.

- **Chat**: Routes user queries to the corresponding services (FAQ or Ticket Operation).

- **Indexing**: Takes internal policies or documents, converts them into chunks, and inserts them into the database for later FAQ usage.

## Chat Workflow

### Architecture

The overall graph is illustrated below:

![chat-graph](./assets/graph.png)

**Responsibilities of each component:**

- **Coordinator**: Routes user requests to the appropriate services and handles small talk/greetings.

- **FAQ**: Powered by a RAG system, it searches for similar internal documents in the database and answers user queries.

- **Operation**: Technically should be named *after-service operation*. Responsible for parsing user queries into corresponding SQL statements.

- **Operation Feedback**: If the user query lacks necessary information, causing the **Operation** node to fail, this component gathers more information through follow-up questions. It is inspired by the Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) system.

### How to Support multimodal query

The current workflow mainly supports text-based interactions.
To handle multimodal input, create an additional node called `multimodal_processor`, which converts images or voice to text before further processing.

## Indexing Workflow

### Architecture

The indexing workflow is illustrated below:

![indexing-workflow](./assets/indexing.png)

**Responsibilities of each component:**

- **Extractor** & **Text Splitter**: Given an unstructured document, extract and convert it into chunks with metadata.

- **Embedding**: Converts text into vector representations.

- **Insert-DB**: Inserts vectors into the database. Currently, only Milvus is supported.
